This project demonstrates how to establish remote control and persistence on a Single Board Computer (SBC) using a Telegram bot. Please ensure that you have proper authorization and adhere to all applicable laws and regulations when using this solution.

## Introduction

This Proof of Concept (PoC) showcases how an SBC can be utilized to ensure persistence on a network and control the device remotely through a Telegram bot. This scenario can be employed for legitimate purposes such as remote management of IoT devices or home automation.

**Requirements:**

1. **Single Board Computer (SBC)**: Ensure you have a configured and operational SBC.

2. **Telegram Bot**: Create a Telegram bot using the BotFather on Telegram and obtain the API token.

## Setup

1. **Installation**: Install a Python script on the SBC that establishes a connection to the Telegram bot using the API token.

2. **Persistence**: Configure the script to run automatically on startup to ensure persistence on the network.

3. **Remote Control**: Define a set of commands that the Telegram bot can recognize and execute on the SBC.

4. **Access Control**: Implement access controls to restrict bot access to authorized users or administrators.

5. **Security Measures**: Apply appropriate security measures, including secure authentication, encryption for communications, and secure handling of sensitive information.

## Usage

1. **Start Chat**: Start a chat with the Telegram bot associated with the SBC.

2. **Authorization**: Authorize access to the bot using secure methods, such as a password or other authentication mechanisms.

3. **Remote Commands**: Use the predefined commands to control and interact with the SBC remotely via the Telegram chat.
